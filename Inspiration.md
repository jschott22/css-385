My inspiration comes from the Star Trek TV shows and movies. 
I always thought it would be really fun to play a game that put you in command of a starship, including all the controls and screens. 
Being able to interact with them and fly the ship seemed like it would make for a really fun experience, especially if combined with a multiplayer system.
I also would expand my inspiration to just science fiction movies from the 70s-80s in general, as I don't want to just rip off one existing property.
I've had a lot of fun playing Microsoft Flight Simulator in the past, and there are some similarities between how that game works and how this game could possibly play.
