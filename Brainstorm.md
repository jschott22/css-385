I want to create a game that takes place on the bridge of a starship.
It would act as a cooperative multiplayer science fiction game that has four positions: pilot, tactician, engineer, and captain.
Each position would have their own controls and duties that they have to work together to use to get past various scenarios.
If the ship and crew can accomplish a set number of scenarios, then they beat the game.
