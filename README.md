Deep Space Five

ELEVATOR PITCH

Deep Space Five is a science fiction video game that predominantly takes place on the bridge of a starship (Figure 1). Four players fulfill specific roles on the bridge and work together using their consoles and instruments to progress through difficult situations as they traverse the galaxy. 

“You are a crew of four in command of a stolen starship designed to hold a crew of 50 highly-trained personnel. You will be tested to your limits. Get to Deep Space Five by any means necessary.”

SYNOPSIS

2-4 players begin their campaign with an introductory cutscene that sets the stage of the narrative. Players board the ship in an expedited fashion with the objective of stealing the ship and navigating a preset course to Deep Space Five. As the ship navigates its preset path, various scenarios will ensue that will test the crew’s abilities. As the ship encounters more scenarios, the difficulty of these situations will escalate, ultimately peaking in the final scenario before reaching the end of the campaign. The campaign ends with the arrival at Deep Space Five, followed by another cinematic cutscene.

OBJECTIVE

The ship follows a loose path and encounters various anomalies or obstacles along its course. Each scenario is randomized to a certain extent, creating variety in how the crewmates must respond to either defuse the situation or bypass the encounter through other means. Crewmates must cooperate and work together to survive.

Each crewmate selects a role (pilot, tactician, engineer, captain). Each role comes with specified duties and responsibilities that must be observed or fulfilled to increase chances of success. Certain duties require communicating observations that may be used by the other crewmates. Some duties are as simple as a button press; others may require more skillful interactions (Figure 2).
